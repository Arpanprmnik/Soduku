Sudoku Puzzle Generator and Solver
This project is a console-based Sudoku game written in C++. It allows users to generate a random Sudoku puzzle, visualize the solving process, and optionally solve it using a backtracking algorithm.

Features
Puzzle Generation: Randomly generates a valid Sudoku puzzle.
Puzzle Solving: Uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle.
Visualization: Step-by-step visualization of the solving process in the terminal.
Difficulty Levels: Option to adjust the puzzle difficulty.
How to Play
The program generates and displays a Sudoku puzzle.
The user is prompted to solve the puzzle by entering Y (yes) or N (no).
If Y is entered, the backtracking algorithm attempts to solve the puzzle with a real-time visualization.
If N is entered, the program terminates.
Controls
Y: Start solving the puzzle with visualization.
N: Exit the game without solving.
Installation and Usage
Prerequisites
Windows: The game uses specific console commands such as SetConsoleCursorPosition and system("cls") for clearing the screen and cursor control, which are compatible with Windows OS.
C++ Compiler: Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., MinGW, MSVC, etc.).
How to Compile
To compile the code, use the following command in the terminal (adjust the command depending on your compiler):

bash
Copy code
g++ main.cpp -o sudoku -std=c++17
Running the Game
After compiling, run the executable:

bash
Copy code
./sudoku
The game will launch and generate a random Sudoku puzzle. You can choose whether to solve it or exit the program.



When solving the puzzle, the algorithm fills the grid in real-time, and the user can see the numbers being placed step by step.

Customization
Difficulty: You can change the difficulty level by modifying the parameter in the generatePuzzle function.
Visualization Speed: Adjust the speed of the visualization by modifying the delay in the sleep function (measured in milliseconds).
Code Structure
main.cpp: Contains the main logic for generating and solving the Sudoku puzzle.
Functions:
generatePuzzle(): Generates a valid Sudoku puzzle with a specified difficulty.
solveSudoku(): Solves the Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.
printPuzzle(): Prints the Sudoku puzzle in a visually appealing format in the terminal.
setCursorPosition(): Moves the cursor for real-time visualization of the solving process.
sleep(): Adds delay for better visualization of the solving process.
Requirements
Windows OS: The game is designed for Windows due to the use of system-specific functions.
C++17 or later: This project uses features from the C++17 standard.
Known Issues
The visualization feature relies on Windows-specific console manipulation, which may not work on non-Windows systems.
